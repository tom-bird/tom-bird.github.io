<html>
	<br /><br /><br />This is a simple simulator of a forest ecosystem.

	<br />Trees grow from sapling to adult to elder. <br />Lumberjacks cut down trees, but are eaten by bears.<br />Bears may die if they are on dirt (non-tree square).

	<br />Built using JS on HTML5 canvas.

  <div id="main-canvas-div">
    <canvas id="main-canvas" width="600" height="600"></canvas>
